# Operator Overloading in Python

## Introduction
Operator overloading allows custom classes to redefine the behavior of standard operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, etc. This makes objects behave more intuitively and enhances code readability.

## Key Concepts
- Redefining built-in operators for user-defined types  
- Implemented using special magic methods (dunder methods)  
- Enables intuitive interaction with custom objects  

## Topics to Learn
- Overloading arithmetic operators (`__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, etc.)  
- Overloading comparison operators (`__eq__`, `__lt__`, `__gt__`, etc.)  
- Understanding how Python maps operators to magic methods  
- Implementing operator behavior in custom classes
